abilities.air.airblast=AirBlast is the most fundamental bending technique of an airbender. To use, simply left-click in a direction. A gust of wind will be created at your fingertips, launching anything in its path harmlessly back. A gust of air can extinguish fires on the ground or on a player, can cool lava, and can flip levers and activate buttons. Additionally, tapping sneak will change the origin of your next AirBlast to your targeted location.
abilities.air.airbubble=To use, the bender must merely have the ability selected. All water around the user in a small bubble will vanish, replacing itself once the user either gets too far away or selects a different ability.
abilities.air.airshield=Air Shield is one of the most powerful defensive techniques in existence. To use, simply sneak (default: shift). This will create a whirlwind of air around the user, with a small pocket of safe space in the center. This wind will deflect all projectiles and will prevent any creature from entering it for as long as its maintained.
abilities.air.airsuction=To use, simply left-click in a direction. A gust of wind will originate as far as it can in that direction  and flow towards you, sucking anything in its path harmlessly with it. Skilled benders can use this technique to pull items from precarious locations. Additionally, tapping sneak will change the origin of your next AirSuction to your targeted location.
abilities.air.airswipe=To use, simply left-click in a direction. An arc of air will flow from you towards that direction, cutting and pushing back anything in its path. Its damage is minimal, but it still sends the message. This ability will extinguish fires, cool lava, and cut things like grass, mushrooms and flowers. Additionally, you can charge it by holding sneak. Charging before attacking will increase damage and knockback, up to a maximum.
abilities.air.airscooter=AirScooter is a fast means of transportation. To use, sprint, jump then click with this ability selected. You will hop on a scooter of air and be propelled forward in the direction you're looking (you don't need to press anything). This ability can be used to levitate above liquids, but it cannot go up steep slopes. Any other actions will deactivate this ability.
abilities.air.airspout=This ability gives the airbender limited sustained levitation. It is a toggle - click to activate and form a whirling spout of air beneath you, lifting you up. You can bend other abilities while using AirSpout. Click again to deactivate this ability.
abilities.air.airburst=AirBurst is one of the most powerful abilities in the airbender's arsenal. To use, press and hold sneak to charge your burst. Once charged, you can either release sneak to launch a cone-shaped burst of air in front of you, or click to release the burst in a sphere around you. Additionally, having this ability selected when you land on the ground from a large enough fall will create a burst of air around you.
abilities.air.airmanipulation=Not ready yet
abilities.air.suffocate=To use, keep sneaking while watching a player and the target while slowly lose his health. The target will also be slower and weaker than before.
abilities.air.tornado=To use, simply sneak (default: shift). This will create a swirling vortex at the targeted location. Any creature or object caught in the vortex will be launched up and out in some random direction. If another player gets caught in the vortex, the launching effect is minimal. Tornado can also be used to transport the user. If the user gets caught in his/her own tornado, his movements are much more manageable. Provided the user doesn't fall out of the vortex, it will take him to a maximum height and move him in the general direction he's looking. Skilled airbenders can scale anything with this ability.
abilities.chiblocker.highjump=To use this ability, simply click. You will jump quite high.  This ability has a short cooldown.
abilities.chiblocker.rapidpunch=This ability allows the chiblocker to punch rapidly in a short period. To use, simply punch. This has a short cooldown.
abilities.chiblocker.vitalpoint=Paralyzes the target, making them unable to do anything for a short period of time. This ability has a long cooldown.
abilities.chiblocker.powerfulhit=Not defined yet
abilities.chiblocker.smokebomb=To use, simply click and a smokebomb will make every player around you blind. While you're in the smokebomb area, you also are invisible.
abilities.chiblocker.dash=This ChiBlocker skill is very useful when you want to travel faster or if you want to avoid some dangerous technics.
abilities.chiblocker.poisonneddart=To use this ability click while aiming a target. You will deal damage to the aimed target. Some items such as potions can edit this effect.
abilities.chiblocker.plasticbomb=Not description yet.
abilities.earth.catapult=To use, left-click while looking in the direction you want to be launched. A pillar of earth will jut up from under you and launch you in that direction - if and only if there is enough earth behind where you're looking to launch you. Skillful use of this ability takes much time and work, and it does result in the death of certain gung-ho earthbenders. If you plan to use this ability, be sure you've read about your passive ability you innately have as an earthbender.
abilities.earth.raiseearth=To use, simply left-click on an earthbendable block. A column of earth will shoot upwards from that location. Anything in the way of the column will be brought up with it, leaving talented benders the ability to trap brainless entities up there. Additionally, simply sneak (default shift) looking at an earthbendable block. A wall of earth will shoot upwards from that location. Anything in the way of the wall will be brought up with it.
abilities.earth.earthgrab=To use, simply left-click while targeting a creature within range. Four earthbendables blocks will come from the ground to trap the creature in.
abilities.earth.earthtunnnel=Earth Tunnel is a completely utility ability for earthbenders. To use, simply sneak (default: shift) in the direction you want to tunnel. You will slowly begin tunneling in the direction you're facing for as long as you sneak or if the tunnel has been dug long enough. This ability will be interupted if it hits a block that cannot be earthbent.
abilities.earth.earthblast=To use, place your cursor over an earthbendable object (bendable block) and tap sneak (default: shift). The object will temporarily turn to stone, indicating that you have it focused as the source for your ability. After you have selected an origin (you no longer need to be sneaking), simply left-click in any direction and you will see your object launch off in that direction, smashing into any creature in its path. If you look towards a creature when you use this ability, it will target that creature. A collision from Earth Blast both knocks the target back and deals some damage. You cannot have multiple of these abilities flying at the same time.
abilities.earth.collapse=To use, simply left-click on an earthbendable block. That block and the earthbendable blocks above it will be shoved back into the earth below them, if they can This ability does have the capacity to trap something inside of it, although it is incredibly difficult to do so. Additionally, press sneak with this ability to affect an area around your targetted location - all earth that can be moved downwards will be moved downwards. This ability is especially risky or deadly in caves, depending on the earthbender's goal and technique.
abilities.earth.tremorsense=This is an useless ability.
abilities.earth.eartharmor=This ability encases the earthbender in temporary armor. To use, click on a block that is earthbendable. If there is another block under it that is earthbendable, the block will fly to you and grant you temporary armor and damage reduction. This ability has a long cooldown.
abilities.earth.shockwave=This is one of the most powerful moves in the earthbender's arsenal. To use, you must first charge it by holding sneak (default: shift). Once charged, you can release sneak to create an enormous shockwave of earth, disturbing all earth around you and expanding radially outwards. Anything caught in the shockwave will be blasted back and dealt damage. If you instead click while charged, the disruption is focused in a cone in front of you. Lastly, if you fall from a great enough height with this ability selected, you will automatically create a shockwave.
abilities.earth.lavatrain=Simply sneaking + click and a lava lake will form under your eyes.
abilities.earth.metalbending=The MetalBending skill is one of the most useful earthbender technique. You can open iron door by clicking while you're on this slot. You can transform most of iron items into iron ingots. You can travel as you were spider-man by using a fishing rod.
abilities.fire.heatcontrol=While this ability is selected, the firebender becomes impervious  to fire damage and cannot be ignited. If the user left-clicks with this ability, the targeted area will be extinguished, although it will leave any creature burning engulfed in flames. This ability can also cool lava. If this ability is used while targetting ice or snow, it will instead melt blocks in that area. Finally, sneaking with this ability will cook any food in your hand.
abilities.fire.blaze=STo use, simply left-click in any direction. An arc of fire will flow from your location, igniting anything in its path. Additionally, tap sneak to engulf the area around you in roaring flames.
abilities.fire.firejet=This ability is used for a limited burst of flight for firebenders. Clicking with this ability selected will launch you in the direction you're looking, granting you controlled flight for a short time. This ability can be used mid-air to prevent falling to your death, but on the ground it can only be used if standing on a block that's ignitable (e.g. not snow or water).
abilities.fire.illumination=This ability gives firebenders a means of illuminating the area. It is a toggle - clicking will create a torch that follows you around. The torch will only appear on objects that are ignitable and can hold a torch (e.g. not leaves or ice). If you get too far away from the torch, it will disappear, but will reappear when you get on another ignitable block. Clicking again dismisses this torch.
abilities.fire.walloffire=To use this ability, click at a location. A wall of fire will appear at this location, igniting enemies caught in it and blocking projectiles.
abilities.fire.fireblast=FireBlast is the most fundamental bending technique of a firebender. To use, simply left-click in a direction. A blast of fire will be created at your fingertips. If this blast contacts an enemy, it will dissipate and engulf them in flames, doing additional damage and knocking them back slightly. If the blast hits terrain, it will ignite the nearby area. Additionally, if you hold sneak, you will charge up the fireblast. If you release it when it's charged, it will instead launch a powerful fireball that explodes on contact.
abilities.fire.fireburst=FireBurst is a very powerful firebending ability. To use, press and hold sneak to charge your burst. Once charged, you can either release sneak to launch a cone-shaped burst of flames in front of you, or click to release the burst in a sphere around you.
abilities.fire.fireshield=FireShield is a basic defensive ability.  Clicking with this ability selected will create a small disc of fire in front of you, which will block most attacks and bending. Alternatively, pressing and holding sneak creates a very small shield of fire, blocking most attacks. Creatures that contact this fire are ignited.
abilities.fire.fireblade=To use, simply click and a powerful blade will appear in your hand.
abilities.fire.combustion=Combustion is a powerful Firebender skill.  You just need to sneak and aim what you want. Then, when the skill will be ready,  the air  around the target will explode
abilities.fire.lightning=Hold sneak while selecting this ability to charge up a lightning strike. Once charged, release sneak to discharge the lightning to the targetted location.
abilities.water.waterbubble=To use, the bender must merely have the ability selected. All water around the user in a small bubble will vanish, replacing itself once the user either gets too far away or selects a different ability.
abilities.water.phasechange=To use, simply left-click. Any water you are looking at within range will instantly freeze over into solid ice. Provided you stay within range of the ice and do not unbind FreezeMelt, that ice will not thaw. If, however, you do either of those the ice will instantly thaw. If you sneak (default: shift), anything around where you are looking at will instantly melt. Since this is a more favorable state for these things, they will never re-freeze unless they would otherwise by nature or some other bending ability. Additionally, if you tap sneak while targetting water with FreezeMelt, it will evaporate water around that block that is above sea level.
abilities.water.healingwaters=To use, the bender must be at least partially submerged in water. If the user is sneaking, this ability will automatically begin working provided the user has it selected. If the user is sneaking, he/she is channeling the healing to their target in front of them. In order for this channel to be successful, the user and the target must be at least partially submerged in water.
abilities.water.watermanipulation=To use, place your cursor over a waterbendable object and tap sneak (default: shift). Smoke will appear where you've selected, indicating the origin of your ability. After you have selected an origin, simply left-click in any direction and you will see your water spout off in that direction, slicing any creature in its path. If you look towards a creature when you use this ability, it will target that creature. A collision from Water Manipulation both knocks the target back and deals some damage. Alternatively, if you have source selected and tap shift again, you will be able to control the water more directly.
abilities.water.surge=This ability has two distinct features. If you sneak to select a source block, you can then click in a direction and a large wave will be launched in that direction. If you sneak again while the wave is en route, the wave will freeze the next target it hits. If, instead, you click to select a source block, you can hold sneak to form a wall of water at your cursor location. Click to shift between a water wall and an ice wall. Release sneak to dissipate it.
abilities.water.waterspout=To use this ability, click while over or in water. You will spout water up from beneath you to experience controlled levitation. This ability is a toggle, so you can activate it then use other abilities and it will remain on. If you try to spout over an area with no water, snow or ice, the spout will dissipate and you will fall. Click again with this ability selected to deactivate it.
abilities.water.icespike=This ability has many functions. Clicking while targetting ice, or an entity over some ice, will raise a spike of ice up, damaging and slowing the target. Tapping sneak (shift) while selecting a water source will select that source that can then be fired with a click. Firing this will launch a spike of ice at your target, dealing a bit of damage and slowing the target. If you sneak (shift) while not selecting a source, many ice spikes will erupt from around you, damaging and slowing those targets.
abilities.water.octopusform=This ability allows the waterbender to manipulate a large quantity of water into a form resembling that of an octopus. To use, click to select a water source. Then, hold sneak to channel this ability. While channeling, the water will form itself around you and has a chance to block incoming attacks. Additionally, you can click while channeling to attack things near you, dealing damage and knocking them back. Releasing shift at any time will dissipate the form.
abilities.water.torrent=Torrent is one of the strongest moves in a waterbender's arsenal. To use, first click a source block to select it; then hold shift to begin streaming the water around you. Water flowing around you this way will damage and knock back nearby enemies and projectiles. If you release shift during this, you will create a large wave that expands outwards from you, launching anything in its path back. Instead, if you click you release the water and channel it to flow towards your cursor. Anything caught in the blast will be tossed about violently and take damage. Finally, if you click again when the water is torrenting, it will freeze the area around it when it is obstructed.
abilities.water.iceswipe=Not defined yet
abilities.water.bloodbending=This ability was made illegal for a reason. With this ability selected, sneak while targetting something and you will bloodbend that target. Bloodbent targets cannot move, bend or attack. You are free to control their actions by looking elsewhere - they will be forced to move in that direction. Additionally, clicking while bloodbending will launch that target off in the direction you're looking. People who are capable of bloodbending are immune to your technique, and you are immune to theirs.
abilities.water.drainbending=The drainbending skill allows the water bender using it to take water from plants and even from the air.

general.errors=There was an error...
general.on_air_choose=As an airbender, you now take no falling damage, have faster sprinting and higher jumps. Additionally, daily activities are easier for you - your food meter decays at a much slower rate
general.on_chi_choose=As a chiblocker, you have no active abilities to bind. Instead, you have improved sprinting and jumping, have a dodge chance and deal more damage with your fists. Additionally, punching a bender will block his/her chi for a few seconds, preventing him/her from bending (and even stopping their passive\!).
general.on_earth_choose=As an earthbender, upon landing on bendable earth, you will briefly turn the area to soft sand, negating any fall damage you would have otherwise taken.
general.on_fire_choose=As a firebender, you now more quickly smother yourself when you catch on fire.
general.on_water_choose=As a waterbender, you no longer take any fall damage when landing on ice, snow or even 1-block-deep water. Additionally, sneaking in the water with a bending ability selected that does not utilize sneak (or no ability at all) will give you accelerated swimming. Lastly, you can pull water from plants with your abilities.
